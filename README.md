# Homework Assignment 1
# CS/CE 412/471 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2025
***

Homework assignments in this course are designed to deepen your understanding of algorithm design principles, enhance your problem-solving skills, and provide hands-on experience with implementing and analyzing algorithms. Through these assignments, you’ll develop critical thinking abilities and gain practical knowledge essential for tackling real-world computational challenges.

# Purpose

This homework aims to strengthen students’ ability to analyze and compare algorithmic complexities, design and implement efficient algorithms using the divide-and-conquer paradigm, and solve recurrence relations. It also encourages clear communication of algorithmic ideas through pseudocode and visualization, fostering a deeper understanding of algorithm design and analysis.

# Background and Requirements

To attempt and submit the homework you will need
- An understanding of asymptotic notations, recurrence relations, and methods to solve them.
- Familiarity with divide-and-conquer algorithms, such as merge sort and binary search.
- The ability to write clear and structured pseudocode following CLRS conventions.
- Experience with Python programming and visualization tools.
- Familiarity with LaTeX.
